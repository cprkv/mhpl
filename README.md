Modern HPL
==========

Engine based on Amnesia: The Dark Descent Source Code.

## HPL2 notice
Currently the engine uses fbx sdk 2012 which isn't avalable anymore which means the engine wont compile. If you want to give a shot anyway you can find the sdk here:

Other than that, here is almost everything you need to build Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Included are project files for Visual Studio 2010 and CMake for Linux & macOS.
